Such capabilities are related to the data portability capabilities required by 45 CFR § 170.314(b)(7)  or are reasonably within the scope of intended uses for those capabilities. As such, the developer must disclose any and all known material limitations or types of costs in connection with the use of data portability and related capabilities. The marketing materials state only that ""costs or limitations may apply for unusual uses or volume."" This statement omits specific information included in the developer's public disclosure statement on its website, which states that the technology can support the export of up to maximum of 100,000 records per day and that a fee of 10 cents per record applies after the first 500 records. [***We have separately documented our assessment of this limitation and pricing practice, which we have determined to be a non-conformity to the data portability criterion]. The statement that ""costs or limitations may apply for unusual uses or volume"" also fails to provide the degree of particularity and plain language required by 523(k)(1)  because it is vague and fails to explain what constitutes an ""unusual use"" or an ""unusual volume."" Having reviewed the marketing materials in their entirety as well as other representations made during the sale and marketing of the developer's technology to the surveilled customers, we find that a customer could not reasonably understand what limitations may apply or what his costs might be to use the data portability capabilities of the certified health IT.  ",,,"The developer stated that the defective disclosures were an oversight by its marketing department, which did not understand the requirements at 45 CFR § 170.523(k)(1). ",,
